# FFLogs Search
Just a simple plugin to add a context menu to search for a user on fflogs.  Another very lazy plugin and the context menu shows up on stuff it shouldn't.  Maybe I'll fix it if it bothers me enough to.  

## DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN TO BE TOXIC 
I made this plugin just to be able to easily search for peoples fflogs.  Parses are not an accurate representation of how good players are.  You can have good parses, but suck at mechs or have bad parses and be great at mechs.  Grey parse or not a clear is a clear and says nothing about a player other than purely their dps.  Please just be nice to people.
